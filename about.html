            <h1 class="about-heading">About</h1>
            <p>I am Karthik PK, a 14 year old student from India. I am originally from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ramanattukara">Ramanattukara</a>, a small city in the district of Kozhikode - formely known as Calicut - which is in Kerala, India. I was born on the 25th of October 2010 which means that I am 14 years old. I am studying in 8<sup>th</sup> standard in a school named <a href="http://www.venerinihss.in/">Venerini EMHSS</a></p>
            <p>My ambition is to become a software developer, possibly an AI / ML Engineer. I am looking forward to my career and I have started learning some programming languages. I know a little bit of Python and Javascript. But I am more fluent in HTML and CSS. I started coding in 2020 during the corona outbreak. So I have about 5 years of experience to this date. My goal is to get into some big companies like Google, Microsoft, Facebook, etc. and learn as much as I can. And maybe start a good start-up if I can. I do plan to become someone famous. And I will definitely help to change this world in a good way. I hope to make my parents and my nation proud. </p>
            <p>I am confident that I have acquired somewhat of a good academic performance through the years and I plan to continue this. I have achieved some medals and trophies in various items. But that's it for now. I am looking forward to  higher education. I hope that I can get into a good college and start a good career. I plan to continue my education until I acquire a master's degree. </p>
